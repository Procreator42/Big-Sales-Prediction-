        "Big Sales Prediction using Random Forest Regressor in ML is a machine learning technique that can be used to predict the sales of a product or service. The Random Forest Regressor is a type of ensemble learning algorithm that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions. The algorithm works by randomly selecting features from the dataset and building a decision tree for each feature. The predictions from each decision tree are then combined to make a final prediction."
